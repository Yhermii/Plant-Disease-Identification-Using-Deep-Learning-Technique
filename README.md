Project Summary
This repository contains a set of Python scripts designed for evaluating and comparing the performance of different deep learning models on a dataset of images. The code includes functionalities for preprocessing images, generating predictions, and summarizing the results through metrics and visualizations.

Features
Image Preprocessing: Resize and preprocess images for model input.
Model Prediction: Generate predictions from multiple models.
Result Summary: Calculate and display metrics such as correct and incorrect predictions.
Visualization: Plot bar charts to compare correct vs. incorrect predictions for each model.

Requirements
Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
tensorflow (or keras if using TensorFlow backend)
You can install the required packages using pip:



Ensure that your models (model_vgg16, model_resnet50, model) and preprocessing functions (vgg16_preprocess_input, resnet_preprocess_input) are correctly defined and imported in your script.
Load your test images (X_test) and test labels (y_test), and make sure they are in the correct format.
Usage
Define Target Size and Preprocessing Functions:

Set the target size for your images and define preprocessing functions for each model.


target_size = (64, 64)

preprocess_functions = [
    vgg16_preprocess_input,
    resnet_preprocess_input,
    vgg16_preprocess_input
]
Specify Your Models and Their Names:

Define a list of your models and their corresponding names.


models = [model_vgg16, model_resnet50, model]
model_names = ['VGG16', 'ResNet50', 'Custom CNN']
Summarize Predictions:

Call the summarize_predictions function to evaluate and visualize your models' performance.



summarize_predictions(models, model_names, X_test, y_test, preprocess_functions, lb.classes_, target_size)
Code Overview
get_predictions_and_labels Function: Processes test images, makes predictions with the given model, and returns predicted labels.
summarize_predictions Function: Evaluates each modelâ€™s predictions, calculates confusion matrices, and summarizes results. Outputs the summary to an Excel file and generates a bar chart of correct vs. incorrect predictions.
